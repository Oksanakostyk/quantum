
Data analysis was performed on the basis of multiple linear regression. the data set is divided into train and test sets in the ratio of 80 to 20%. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated. The following values for MAE, MSE and RMSE were obtained
Mean Absolute Error: 25.083230159214832
Mean Squared Error: 837.1186965299518
Root Mean Squared Error: 28.93300358638819

The RMSE is quite large. It is about 58% of the mean, which indicates a significant spread of the data around mean, and to improve the description of the data, a non-linear model can be chosen.
